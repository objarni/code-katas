Ideas for problems to formulate
-------------------------------

* The Beast. Possibly based on the 'edit paid booking' from work experience (a 500+ line if-upon-if-upon-if function/object that was responsible for too much things at once!)
* X-Worm. Maybe pick a part of this game and make into a problem?
