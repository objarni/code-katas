Code Katas
==========

by Olof Bjarnason.

The purpose of this repository is to collect a set of
practice problems, specifically intended to help development
teams practice programming with a focus on quality via
unit test practices such as TDD, Test-Driven Development.


Organization
------------

Under `start-points`, you will find problems, in no particular
order. Under each problem directory in Problems, there will
be a separate folder for each relevant programming language.


Themes
------

Learning how to write code "TDD-style" requires a lot of
training and persistent efforts, but there are some stepping
stones:

  - practicing how to write a test to reproduce a bug
  - practicing how name unit tests maintainably
  - practicing Arrange-Act-Assert
  - practicing the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
  - practicing 'what' instead of 'how' thinking
  - practicing KISS and YAGNI principles
  - practicing 'results ordered coding'
  - practicing refactorings of different kinds
  - practicing SOLID principles
  - practicing design patterns

Hopefully, the Code Katas in this repo will cover
all of those areas!
